# autocompleteBS (alpha)
A Javascript autocomplete library for Bootstrap.

## Description
The intention of this library is to make it easier add autocomplete functionality for bootstrap projects. To date not a lot of effort has been made to make the library cross browser compatible but it does use vanilla JS to remove any dependencies on any other JavaScript libraries.

Demo: [Lookups by Capital or Country](https://kanine.github.io/autocompleteBS/demo/autocompleteBS.html)

## Features
* Simple configuration to add autocomplete to inputs
* Allow multiple autocompletes on the page
* Keyboard controls to navigate list (Up, Down, Tabbing, Escape and Enter)
* Use a GET fetch call with the 'term' variable set

## To Do List
* Filtering of results that come back raw, eg JSON lists of countries
* More configration options, eg own search/regex functions
* Static lists without the use of Fetch
* Cross browser testing
* A lot more testing and error handling!
